About me.
My name is Jeff Nishihira. I am a Chicago-based designer, developer, animator, and artist.
In January of 2000, I embarked on a career in interactive multimedia and motion graphics. As a computer animation major at Columbia College Chicago, I crawled into a bag labeled "Flash", became a master at it while working several early jobs as a designer and animation specialist, and didn't crawl out for about eight years.
Fortunately, during this time, I also mastered HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Perl (CGI). I picked up PHP and MySQL while working at my first internship, and eventually became a full-time LAMP-stack developer.
Since then, I've been the lead designer and developer at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, built several large-scale applications, created 3D and traditional animations for video projects, built and maintained the entire web presence for National Louis University, and learned guitar.
I've also picked up Coldfusion (not to be confused with confusion!), Jquery, and Swift.
